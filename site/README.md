# Getting started

CAOS Site is a github action that generates a static page out of markdown files. It uses marked.js in combination with highlight.js to compile and style markdown.
The documentation is built according to the structure of a docs `folder`[Folder](https://github.com/caos/site/tree/master/site/docs) located at root of the targeted repository.

## Running locally

You can simply run the static site by using the docker-compose command below.

```Bash
