You have successfully integrated ZITADEL in your Angular Application! 

If you get stuck consider checking out our [template](https://github.com/caos/zitadel-angular-template) application which includes all the mentioned functionality of this quickstart. You can simply start by cloning the repo and replacing the AuthConfig in the app.module with your own configuration. If your run into issues don't hesitate to contact us or raise an issue on [Github](https://github.com/caos/zitadel).

### Whats next?

Now you can proceed implementing our APIs to include Authorization. Refer to our [Docs](apis#Authentication_API) or checkout our Console Code on [Github](https://github.com/caos/zitadel) which is using GRPC to access data.
