### Use cloud instance zitadel.ch

To create a ZITADEL project, you have to register as an organization first. Click [here](https://accounts.zitadel.ch/register/org) to register.
You will receive an email prompting you to verify your mail.
Then go to your [Console Projects](https://console.zitadel.ch/projects) view and create a new project.

<div class="zitadel-gallery" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageGallery">
    <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
        <a href="img/accounts_org_register_light.png" itemprop="contentUrl" data-size="840x1398">
            <img src="img/accounts_org_register_light.png" itemprop="thumbnail" alt="Organisation Overview" />	
        </a>
        <figcaption itemprop="caption description">Organisation Register</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

Now you can proceed adding users to your organization as well as integrating your applications. We refer to our guides as well as our [quickstarts](quickstarts) to do so.

#### Verify your domain name (optional)

If you verify a domain you get the benefit that your organisations users can use this domain as the **preferred logonname**.

#### Elect Managers

ZITADEL allows you to give other users control over ZITADEL Console itself. This can be restricted to some kind of write and/or read. This can be especially useful for directing administration over several users. You can have managers able to edit project settings and others able to create/add users only.
Read the [guides](guides) for more information.

> Note: ZITADEL Managers are always located on the right sidepanel of console.

#### Integrating an application

After creating your project you can start integrating your applications.
After choosing your [project](https://console.zitadel.ch/projects) add a client application on the top of the page.
The wizard should provide some guidance what client is the proper for you. If you are still unsure consult our [Quickstart Guides](quickstarts).
