### Human vs. Machine

ZITADEL supports human an machine users. We call human users simply "Users" and machine users "Service Users".

With Service Users you would typically secure backend services. For example in ZITADEL you would require an authenticated Service User to access the Management API. The main difference between human and machine users is the type of credentials that can be used for authentication: Human users typically logon via an login prompt, but Machine users require a non-interactive logon process.

### Exercise: Create a Service User

1. Navigate to Service Users
2. Click on **New**
3. Enter a user name and a display name

    <a href="img/console_serviceusers_create.gif" itemprop="contentUrl" data-size="1920x1080">
        <img src="img/console_serviceusers_create.gif" itemprop="thumbnail" alt="console_serviceusers_create" />
    </a>
    <figcaption itemprop="caption description">Create new service user</figcaption>
</figure>

### Authenticating a service user

In ZITADEL we use the `private_jwt` (**“JWT bearer token with private key”**, [RFC7523](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7523)) authorization grant for this non-interactive authentication.

You need to follow these steps to authenticate a service user and receive a access token:

1. Generate a private-public key pair in ZITADEL 
2. Create a JSON Web Token (JWT) and sign with private key
3. With this JWT, request an OAuth token from ZITADEL

With this token you can make subsequent requests, just like a human user.

### Exercise: Get an access token

In this exercise we will authenticate a service user and receive an access_token to 

> **Information:** Are you stuck? Don't hesitate to reach out to us on [Github Discussions](https://github.com/caos/zitadel/discussions) or [contact us](https://zitadel.ch/contact/) privately.

#### 1. Generate a private-public key pair in ZITADEL

Select your service user and in the section KEYS click **New**. Enter an expiration date and click **Add**. Make sure to download the json by clicking **Download**. 

<figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <a href="img/console_serviceusers_new_key.gif" itemprop="contentUrl" data-size="1920x1080">
        <img src="img/console_serviceusers_new_key.gif" itemprop="thumbnail" alt="console_serviceusers_new_key" />
    </a>
    <figcaption itemprop="caption description">Create private key</figcaption>
</figure>

The downloaded json should look something like outlined below. The value of `key` contains the *private* key for your service account. Please make sure to keep this key securely stored and handle with care. The public key is automatically stored in ZITADEL.

```json
{
    "type":"serviceaccount",
    "keyId":"100509901696068329",
    "key":"-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- [...] -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
    "userId":"100507859606888466"
}
```

#### 2. Create a JWT and sign with private key

You need to create a JWT with the following header and payload and sign it with the RS256 algorithm.

Header
```json
{
    "alg": "RS256",
    "kid":"100509901696068329"
}
```
Make sure to include `kid` in the header with the value of `keyId` from the downloaded JSON.

Payload
```json
{
	"iss": "100507859606888466",
	"sub": "100507859606888466",
	"aud": "https://issuer.zitadel.ch",
    "iat": [Current UTC timestamp, e.g. 1605179982],
	"exp": [UTC timestamp, max. 1 hour from iat, e.g. 1605183582]
}
```

* `iss` represents the requesting party, i.e. the owner of the private key. In this case the value of `userId` from the downloaded JSON.
* `sub` represents the application. Set the value also to the value of `userId`
* `aud` must be ZITADEL's issuing domain
* `iat` is a unix timestamp of the creation signing time of the JWT, e.g. now
* `exp` is the unix timestamp of expiry of this assertion. Must be less than 1 hour from `iat`

Please refer to [JWT_with_Private_Key](/architecture#JWT_with_Private_Key#JWT_with_Private_Keyvate_Key) in the documentation for further information.

> **Information:** The `exp` claim is currently not validated, but will be with a future release. Make sure that `exp` is less than 1 hour starting from `iat`.

If you use Go, you might want to use the [provided tool](https://github.com/caos/zitadel-tools) to generate a JWT from the downloaded json. There are many [libraries](https://jwt.io/#libraries-io) to generate and sign JWT. 

#### 3. With this JWT, request an OAuth token from ZITADEL

With the encoded JWT from the prior step, you will need to craft a POST request to ZITADEL's token endpoint:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.zitadel.ch/oauth/v2/token \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer \
  --data scope='openid profile email' \
  --data assertion=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiL...
```

* `grant_type` should be set to `urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer`
* `scope` should contain any [Scopes](/architecture#Scopes) you want to include, but must include `openid`. For this example, please include `profile` and `email`
* `assertion` is the encoded value of the JWT that was signed with your private key from the prior step

You should receive a successful response with `access_token`,  `token_type` and time to expiry in seconds as `expires_in`.

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "access_token": "MtjHodGy4zxKylDOhg6kW90WeEQs2q...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 43199
}
```

#### 4. Verify that you have a valid access toaken

For this example let's call the userinfo endpoint to verfiy that our access token works.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.zitadel.ch/oauth/v2/userinfo \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer MtjHodGy4zxKylDOhg6kW90WeEQs2q...'
```
You should receive a response with your service user's information. 

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "MyServiceUser",
  "preferred_username": "service_user@acme.zitadel.ch",
  "updated_at": 1616417938
}
```

### Knowledge Check

* The JWT header must contain a property `kid` with the value of the key ID
    - [ ] yes
    - [ ] no
* After generating a key for your service user, you must download the public key and sign your JWT with the public key
    - [ ] yes
    - [ ] no

### Summary

* With service users you can secure machine-to-machine communication
* Because there is no interactive logon, you need to use a JWT signed with your private key to authorize the user
* After successful authorization you can use an access token like for human users

* Management API
* Securing backend API
