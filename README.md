## What Is ZITADEL

**ZITADEL** is a "Cloud Native Identity and Access Management" solution built for the cloud era. ZITADEL uses a modern software stack consisting of [**Golang**](https://golang.org/), [**Angular**](https://angular.io/) and  [**CockroachDB**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) as sole storage and follows an event sourced pattern.

We built **ZITADEL** not only with the vision of becoming a great open source project but also as a superb platform to support developers building their applications, without need to handle secure user login and account management themselves.

## How Does It Work

We built **ZITADEL** around the idea that the IAM should be easy to deploy and scale. That's why we tried to reduce external systems as much as possible.
For example, **ZITADEL** is event sourced but it does not rely on a pub/sub system to function. Instead we built all the functionality right into one binary.
**ZITADEL** only needs [**Kubernetes**](https://kubernetes.io/) for orchestration and [**CockroachDB**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) as storage.

## Features of ZITADEL platform

* Authentication
    * OpenID Connect 1.0 Protocol (OP)
    * Username / Password
    * Machine-to-machine (JWT profile)

* Multifactor authentication with OTP, U2F
* Federation with OpenID Connect 1.0 Protocol (RP), OAuth 2.0 Protocol (RP)
* Authorization via Role Based Access Control (RBAC)
* Identity Brokering
* Delegation of roles to other organizations for self-management
* Strong audit trail for all IAM resources
* User interface for administration
* APIs for Management, Administration, and Authentication
* Policy configuration and enforcement

## How To Use It

### ZITADEL Cloud

We provide a cloud service [**ZITADEL.ch**](https://zitadel.ch) where people can register their own organization. There is a **free tier** including unlimited users and all the security features you need.

### Run ZITADEL in the cloud or on-premise

**ZITADEL** is free open source software under [Apache 2.0](##License) managed by [CAOS](https://caos.ch). We provide our community access to ZITADEL releases at no cost and welcome all contributions.

You can run **ZITADEL** in combination with [**ORBOS**](https://github.com/caos/orbos/) for easy and scalable operation on 
* **[GCEProvider](https://cloud.google.com/compute)**
* **[StaticProvider](https://github.com/caos/orbos/blob/master/docs/orbiter/static.md)**
* Any CNCF conform Kubernetes

> Stay tuned, we will soon publish a more detailed guide on how you can deploy a **hyperconverged** system on your own.

### Let us run ZITADEL for you

If  our cloud service or running **ZITADEL** on your own infrastructure does not work for you, we are happy to run a private instance of **ZITADEL** for you or provide you with our support services. [Get in touch!](https://zitadel.ch/contact/)
